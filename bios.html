              When I was younger I ended up in the hospital alot.  I remeber that the calgary childrens hospital had a N64 station and I think that was my first exposure to that system.  I remeber how that it made the visits not as intimidating, not as scary.  I had something to look forward to even if I was hurting or sick.  It brought hope when I was down, since then all games have held that quality of hope for me.  Even as I struggle with my current demons they have become a helpful tool and a constant companion.  I am hoping to raise 1000$ this year and beat my old record

              Being sick is never fun - epsecially when you're stuck in a hospital instead of the comfort of your own room. I'm streaming to raise money for hospitals to keep up all the amazing work they do so kids can get out of bed and do the things kids are meant to do. By raising money, I hope that the time kids find themselves stuck in the hopsital, they're able to find some fun and enjoyment.          </p>

                Video games are really fun, and video games with friends in the same room is even better. Slap on a good cause and we have a great weekend that I could never say no to, even if Zach wasn't forcing me to do this.          </p>

            Growing up with video games being a part of our culture really influenced how we all turned out. I know I would be a different person if it were not for games. I think its great if we get to use games to make some money for charity, as well as be a positive part of video game culture.

            Growing up with 4 brothers meant I was never in search of others to play games with.  I grew up assuming everyone had a similar opportunity, hopefully this could help kids experience the same excitement from games as I do.

          Video Games are more than just a passion for me. They helped me figure out who I am. Being the hero, solving puzzles, or laughing with friends, games have always brought joy into my life.  No matter the challenge, games have always been there to back me up. I want others to feel the same joy. I am huge fan of Speedrunning and the organization "Games Done Quick". When I lost my father, GDQ is what I clung to, and their livestream for charity sparked something inside of me Ill never forget. They were helping save lives like other fathers and familes. I made a decision to join this community to help spread the love in this world. I learned to Speedrun my favorite game, Paper Mario The Thousand Year Door, and since then Ive always hoped to join charity streams in hopes of making a difference in someones life. Whether its raising money, or sparking a passion in someone like me. For me, this is going a step further than just streaming and Youtubing, this is me making a difference in someones life. Maybe someone will watch me livestream for charity and I can spark the same thing inside them to make a difference and spread the love in this world.
