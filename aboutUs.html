          <h1> Who we are </h1>
          <p>
              Button Smashers is a tight knit group of friends that are raising money and awareness for the Child's Play Charity by playing video games for forty-eight hours straight. The gameplay will range from playful games with low experience players to high end precision gameplay to both entertain and raise awareness for the charity. The Charity Child's Play is dedicated to improving the lives of children in hospitals and domestic abuse shelters around the world through the kindness and generosity of the video game community and the power of play.

          <h1> Child's Play </h1>
          <p>
            Since 2003, we've set up and organized Child's Play, a game industry charity dedicated to improving the lives of children with toys and games in our network of over 100 hospitals worldwide. Over the years, you as a community have answered the call and come together to raise over 44.3 million dollars.

            Child's Play works in two ways. With the help of hospital staff, we set up gift wish lists full of video games, toys, books, and other fun stuff for kids. By clicking on a hospital location on our map, you can view that hospital's wish list and send a gift.

            Child's Play also receives cash donations throughout the year. With those cash donations, we purchase new consoles, peripherals, games, and more for hospitals and therapy facilities. These donations allow for children to enjoy age-appropriate entertainment, interact with their peers, friends, and family, and can provide vital distraction from an otherwise generally unpleasant experience.
